## Description

I designed this webpage using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion to make it look good and interactive on any device. I used Next.js to build the webpage, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Framer Motion for adding smooth animations. Overall, I aimed to make the design attractive, user-friendly, and engaging.
